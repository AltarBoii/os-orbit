The `<Schema>` component is inspired by [`react-schemaorg`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-schemaorg) and powered by the [`schema-dts`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/schema-dts) package for full TypeScript definitions.

The component (1) adds type checking to validate user-provided schema JSON, (2) escapes the JSON data, and (3) outputs a `<script type="type="application/ld+json">` with the escaped schema.

Users can provide one or more schema object. If an array of related objects is provided, they will be included in a graph schema with the `@graph` syntax.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

This package is hosted on [`npm`][npm].

```bash
npm install astro-seo-schema
```

Or using yarn

```bash
yarn add astro-seo-schema
```

## ðŸ¥‘ Usage

To add a base set of SEO tags in any of your Astro pages, import Astro `Seo` and then use the component inside the `<head>` section of your HTML:

```jsx index.astro
---
import { Schema } from "astro-seo-schema"
import { BlogPosting } from 'schema-dts';

/** metadata defined by user with full TypeScript validation from `schema-dts` */
